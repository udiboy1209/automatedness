Waves Simulator is an app which simulates, in real time, the vibration of a string under the action of various waves superimposed on it. 
You can specify the amplitude, frequency and initial phase of each wave, and also fix the speed of waves on the string.
It also lets you plot the individual components of the wave seperately.
Many interesting plots can be formed, ranging from simple sine waves to standing waves, beats and much more complex superpositions.

#### The Controls

 - Click on "Add Wave" to add a wave. Specify frequency, amplitude, initial phase and tick the checkbox if you want to see this individually on the screen
 - Click on "Start Simulation" to start the simulation
 - You can edit/remove waves by clicking on them in the list
