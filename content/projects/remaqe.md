title: REMaQE - Reverse Engineering Math Equations from Executables
date: 2023-03-23
category: Research
tag: PhD Project
summary: Embedded systems implement many math-heavy algorithms. Reverse engineering embedded device binaries is not a simple decompilation of assembly to C code. The REMaQE framework is intended to extract the math equations from the implemented binary using symbolic execution and dynamic analysis.
