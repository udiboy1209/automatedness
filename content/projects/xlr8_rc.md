summary: This is a blutooth remote control for a differential drive robot. I implemented it with help of other Electronics Club, IITB members for participants of a college competition. Requires an android app, and an avr circuit to interface with the HC-05. Read more details on [this blog](https://elec-club-iitb.github.io/blog/2016/03/remote-controlling-a-bot-with-android).
