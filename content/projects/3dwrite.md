title: 3D Write
tag: CLI
category: Hobby
date: 2016-04-25
summary: Put me in an overnight train with no internet and a laptop with a fully charged battery and you get this. Write in a **3D font** in the terminal! Its basically a custom designed 3D font using ascii characters and a python script which uses that to write text. Check the README on the github repo, or this page's source if you want to see an example :D
