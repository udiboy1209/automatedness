title: Side-channel using Reorder Buffer
date: 2019-06-28
category: Research
tag: Master's thesis
summary: Reorder buffer is an important component of an Out-of-Order core utilised in the Tomasulo algorithm. In an SMT context, this Reorder Buffer may either be shared among threads or statically partitioned. This allows for a side-channel leakage to occur because a shared Reorder Buffer will lead to interference among the two threadâ€™s IPC.
