Hello! I am **Meet Udeshi**. 
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile photo" title="Yes, that's me." style="margin: 10px; width: 30%; float:right;"/>
Since Sept. 2022, I am a PhD student at the department of **Electrical & Computer Engineering, NYU Tandon**.
I am advised by [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) and [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri),
as part of the [Control/Robotics Research Lab (CRRL)](https://crrl.poly.edu/) and the 
[Center for Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nyu.edu/).

My research focus is on the cybersecurity of embedded systems, control systems, and cyber-physical systems.
My interests include hardware security, firmware binary analysis, reverse engineering, and applications of machine learning to security.
Check out my [research](/research) page for recent publications and projects.

Previously, I was a senior engineer at Qualcomm Bengaluru in the **ML Compiler Team**.
I worked on the compiler stack for the
[Cloud AI100 Accelerator](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/cloud-artificial-intelligence) platform.

I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in **Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay** (Mumbai, India) in 2019.
My Master's was focused on hardware security, as part of [Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab (CADSL)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~cadsl/)
guided by [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/). For my thesis, I designed a denial-of-service attack for the memory prefetcher.


I am an avid reader of manga and thriller novels. I love sketching, gardening, brewing tea and coffee in my free time.
I keep publishing hobby projects on github, you can find a (rarely updated) list on the [projects](/hobby) page.
