Hello! I am Meet Udeshi. 
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile photo" title="Yes, that's me." style="margin: 10px; width: 30%; float:right;"/>
I am a PhD student at the [Control/Robotics Research Lab (CRRL)](https://crrl.poly.edu/) and the 
[Center for Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nyu.edu/), New York University.
I am advised by [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) and [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri).
My research focus is on hardware security. I am currently working on the semantic reverse engineering of embedded systems binaries to
extract high-level semantic information, such as math equations of the implemented control logic.

Previously, I was a Senior Engineer at Qualcomm Corporate R&D in the **ML Compiler Team**.
I worked on the compiler stack for the
[Cloud AI100 Accelerator](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/cloud-artificial-intelligence) platform.

I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay
(Mumbai, India) in 2019.
My Master's thesis was focused on hardware security,
as part of [Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab (CADSL)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~cadsl/)
guided by [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/). For my thesis, I designed a denial-of-service attack for the memory prefetcher.

Check out my [research](/research) page for more details.

I am an avid reader of manga and thriller novels. I love sketching, gardening, brewing tea and coffee in my free time.
I keep publishing hobby projects on github, you can find a (rarely updated) list on the [projects](/hobby) page.
