Hello! I am Meet Udeshi. 
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile photo" title="Yes, that's me." style="margin: 10px; width: 30%; float:right;"/>
I am currently employed at Qualcomm Corporate R&D as an **ML Compiler Engineer**
in the AI Software Team.
I work on the compiler stack for the
[Cloud AI100 Accelerator](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/cloud-artificial-intelligence) platform.
I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay
(Mumbai, India) in 2019.
My Master's thesis was focused on **hardware security**,
as part of [Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab (CADSL)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~cadsl/)
guided by [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/).

My research interests revolve around computer architecture and span many domains like hardware security,
ML accelerators, code generation for SIMD architectures and low-power computing.
In Qualcomm, I am currently working on **automatic SIMD code generation** using dataflow analysis and polyhedral optimization.
I am also continuously developing innovative **graph optimization** techniques which are applicable to
ML models for tasks like 2D and 3D computer vision, autonomous driving, recommendation systems and natural language processing.
In CADSL, I have worked on a **prefetcher-disabling attack** which can reduce interference with cache side channels and amplify information leakage.
I have also worked on the **Heterogenous-ISA Dynamic Core**, a composite core architecture which combines support for multiple ISAs.

I am an avid reader of manga and thriller novels. I love sketching, gardening and brewing tea in my free time.
