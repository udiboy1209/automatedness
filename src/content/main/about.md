Hello! I am *Meet Udeshi*. 
Since Sept. 2022, I am a PhD student at *NYU Tandon* where I am advised by [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami) and [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri) in the [Control/Robotics Research Lab (CRRL)](https://crrl.poly.edu/) and the 
[Center for Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nyu.edu/).
My research focus is on the security of cyber-physical systems and embedded systems.
My interests include hardware security, firmware binary analysis, reverse engineering, and applications of LLMs to cybersecurity.

Previously, I was a senior engineer at Qualcomm Bengaluru in the *ML Compiler Team*.
I worked on the compiler stack for the
[Cloud AI100 Accelerator](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/cloud-artificial-intelligence) platform.
I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in *Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay* (Mumbai, India) in 2019.
My Master's was focused on hardware security, as part of [Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab (CADSL)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~cadsl/)
guided by [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/). For my thesis, I designed a denial-of-service attack for the memory prefetcher.

I am an avid reader of manga and novels. I love sketching, gardening, brewing tea and coffee in my free time.
I keep publishing hobby projects on github, you can find a (rarely updated) list on the [projects](/projects#personal) page.
